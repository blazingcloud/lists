## Project Team
Trust the product champion.  If there is consistent or strong disagreement with the product champion about the product, talk to the project manager, your manager, and the account manager (usually in that order).

Every person is responsible for following the Blazing Path and helping their team members to do so.

### Design
* Visual and interaction design
* Experience design of everything that touches the people who interact with the software (including emails, facebook notifications, URL naming)
* Design Review
  * Never deliver something to a client before internal design review
  * Be clear with internal deliveries whether for internal feedback (pre-design review) or ready for client-delivery or implementation
* Identify & articulate target customer
* User & market research
* Messaging & message test design (in coordination with Engineering)
* Usability testing (including recommending the timing / use cases to be tested)
* Maintain Blazing Path documentation (periodically making modifications or additional templates based on feedback from team members)

### Engineering

* Don't write code unless you can connect the result of that code to the client business goal
* Have the skills required to do stories assigned or communicate what you will need to learn in order to acquire those skills
* Pro-actively Communicate with the Project Manager
  * Identify issues that affect quality or velocity
  * Escalate schedule conflicts, dependencies not met
  * Identify opportunity for better software or faster delivery
* Software Delivery
  * Submit to the app store and/or deploy to staging/production
  * Add/remove devices from testflight/Apple dev portal
  * Make sure we have set up systems for running/monitoring production code
* Follow internal engineering processes
  * All code is in source control (typically checked in multiple times a day)
  * Don't check in code on master without pairing or code review unless an exception is authorized by project manager and product champion is in the loop
* Technical requirements analysis (usually per request as part of pre-sales)

### Product Champion

Focused on whether we are delivering a great product that meets business goals within the budget / calendar time constraints.

* Refine Product Approach, based on initial analysis from business team
  * Requirements Analysis
  * What are the business goals, key value & growth assumptions?
  * Facilitation of product conceptualization and definition, in collaboration with design & engineering
* Communicate key decisions and why they were made to the project manager
* Make sure the stories are well-written (either by customer or by themselves)
* Prioritize stories in collaboration with customer
* Recommendations about product definition & requirements (e.g.making the short-term decisions about what we will recommend to the client and create in between meetings with the client NOT- making final decisions about what features to implement)
* First point of contact for customer reporting bugs
* Weekly progress communication (prep for & communicate at weekly meeting with project manager)
  * what was significant about this week's work?  
  * review time spent by team
  * how did the time worked contribute to the business goals?
  * make recommendations, if appropriate, to allocate time to professional development or internal tools
* Onboarding of staff within project team (in coordination with overall company onboarding, if someone is brand new)
* figure out what customer thinks they need, vs. actually need aka "requirements"


### Project Manager

The "bucks stops here" person, our safety net, nothing should escape this person.  Focused on meeting client expectations and communicating that we are meeting them (and escalate risks to account manager in advance), work with team to optimize velocity, and make sure we consistently deliver quality software.

* Project Spin Up Checklists
  * Create and update wiki project template doc
  * Create a google group and other communication channels (hip chat)
  * Create a contact list for the project
  * Creating accounts for the various services (Heroku, AWS, etc)
  * Add people to harvest, github, and other internal services
  * Data required of the customer to submit to the app store
* Coordinating design / development schedules (resources, deliverables, etc.)
* Document and Communicate Schedule - original/ current- Note and Surface Changes
  * Milestones
  * Weekly status update to the client
  * Project product end date
  * Raise risks with regard to budget and schedule / raise opportunities for new work
  * Document key decision and why those decisions were made
* Coordination for engineering resources (software licenses, contacts, questions not immediately addressable by client)
* Make sure these key meetings happen
  * Retro (team members should take turns leading retro)
  * Stand ups (team should make this happen, as long as 2+ members of the team are working)
  * Iteration planning meetings (led by product champion, meet in advance to make sure that design, ideation and other high level planning meetings are kept separate and that everyone is prepared for this)
  * Acceptance: escalate to account manager if all stories aren't accepted weekly
* Establish clear communication for all critical customer / production escalations
* Twice Weekly Schedule check (should be redundant)
  * Pivotal Tracker: are all stories estimated? is the ship date before when stories end?
  * Design: will design deliverables be completed before engineering is expected to start on those use cases
  * Are all client deliverables on track?
  * Have all open issues been communicated via email with account manager, client, and product champion?
  * Are we following internal processes? and agreed on client processes?
* Product Release
  * Deployment checklist (+1 week before first deploy, verify that this checklist reflects best of team knowledge)
  * Send release notes
  * Review test plan (and write it if needed)
